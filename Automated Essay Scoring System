1. Project Description
In this project, an automated essay scoring system is built to score essays as human expert graders.
Because of the subjectivity and the fact that process is time consuming, methods of checking student’s
grasp of course material have become uncreative and now include multiple-choice or fill-in-blank tests.
These limit the ability of students to express their understanding freely and emphatically. If the manual
grading process can be relieved by an efficient and accurate automated grading system, essays and other
creative methods could be frequently used to indicate academic achievements. We are introducing a model
that forms word representations by learning the extent to which specific words contribute to the text’s
score and predict a final essay grade on a marking scale. Our model will typically use a large range of
textual features that correspond to different properties of text, such as grammar, vocabulary, style, topic
relevance, and discourse coherence and cohesion.

A detailed description of the columns contained within the dataset can be found at:

parameters from the dataset.

Potential Methodologies
Some of the methodologies that we could use for this project are: KNN, Neural Networks, Long Short
Term Memory, and Clustering, which are types of Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning
utilizing the TensorFlow and Keras packages that come with Python.
